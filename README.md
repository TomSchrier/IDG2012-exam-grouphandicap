# IDG2012-exam-grouphandicap

Final assignment

The final assignment comprises two parts: creating an accessible and usable single-page website/web application (the project) and the documentation of the project (the project report).
Each group will deliver one project and one report.

Project
The goal of the project is to create a single-page website that displays, in a usable and accessible way, the same exercise instructions shown in the provided starting image workoutplan.jpg.
The starting images depict the 7-minute workout, a series of calisthenics exercises to be carried out in 7 minutes, doing each exercise for 30 seconds and resting for 5 seconds between exercises. Some exercises require changing sides.

Rules of the game (requirements, features)
All following criteria must be fulfilled to pass the exam.
1. The page must contain all the content that is in the images (text, steps, illustrations).
2. The website must be fully accessible and usable by the users described in the Personas section.
3. There must be a progress functionality that guides the user through the exercises and shows where in the workout the user is.
4. It must be possible for the user to choose which exercises will be included in the workout and which will be excluded.
5. It must be possible to exclude from the workout exercises that focus on a certain body part. 6. You can use any technology understood by Firefox, Chrome or Safari.
7. The site must work with at least one screen reader (your choice).
Extra features
These extra features should be implemented but are not needed to pass the exam.
8. It should be possible to change the length of a workout from the default 7 minutes.
9. It should be possible to pause and resume a workout, without losing any progress in that workout.
10. It should be possible to store / track completed workouts and show the history of past completed workouts.

Personas
The following personas respresent some of the real users of your website.

Francis
Francis is a 24-year old woman living in Edinburgh. She is blind since her birth. Francis works as a journalist in a local newspaper. Since May 2020 she works from home with her personal laptop, a brand-new Dell with Windows 10. Francis has always been interested in techy things and prefers Firefox to Internet Explorer. Her only phone is an old, but rock-solid, Nokia featurephone with a voice interface.
Since the lockdown Francis has noticed that she does not walk as much as before and has started looking for online workouts. However, she has found out that she is not able to follow online videos. The instructions are complex and narrated over loud music, making it hard to understand. Francis also finds it hard to do any exercise that requires jumps because it is easy for her to lose her balance.

Egil
Egil is a 82-year old retired factory worker from Kautokeino, Finnmark. He has always been involved in local politics and was the foreman at the factory union; which makes his current age very frustrating, because his hands are starting to fail him.
Previously, he would write columns for the local newspaper to express his concerns, but now that so much of the discussion is happening on facebook, he is forced to adapt to stay relevant. His son recently got him an iPad Air 2 to make the clickable surfaces bigger, but it’s still frustrating.
He also tries to stay in shape by working out in his basement from time to time.

Guri
Guri is an enthusiastic lady who happened to get into a nasty accident and had to retire from work. She was attending ergotherapy before the covid situation.
Now, she has to workout from home, due to covid restrictions. The challenge is that most workout programmes assume that the user can easily follow the pace of the exercises and are able to perform all exercises including jumps, something that Guri cannot do.

James
James is a 36-year old businessman with an eye for good sales. Was born and raised in Paris, but has moved to London as the company he works for has its headquarters there.

Although he lives in London, he is rarely at home and spends large parts of the year traveling to and from meetings to secure the best contracts.
James travels a lot on planes and must therefore limit how much he has with him at all times, but since he still has to be able to work, he has acquired a narrow but long phone to be able to have as much information as possible on the screen at the same time.
James is an active man, but since he travels so much, he has to squeeze in a training session when he has the opportunity. Unfortunately, it often becomes difficult for him to see the whole exercise as his Sony Xperia1 phone is very narrow and the pictures of the exercise then extend beyond the borders of his screen.

Project report
The project report is a reflection document that explains which design and development choices have been taken and why they have been taken. It also documents which choices have not been taken, and the reason not to take them, as well as possible future enhancements.
In particular, the project report should highlight how usability and accessibility features have been implemented and tested at the HTML, CSS and JavaScript level.
The project report is not a progress report. It should not describe in chronological order the development process.
The language of the report must be either English (preferred) or Norwegian Bokmål. The structure of the project report is free. It must not be longer than 12 pages.
The project report must contain at least the following sections:
• Introduction: what is this website about, what problems are you trying to solve (assume the report will be read by somebody in the general public).
• Usability report: Is the website usable? Which design choices have you taken to improve usability? How was the usability been tested? What are the results?
• Accessibility report: What have you done to make this website accessible? How has the accessibility been tested? What are the results of the accessibility testing? Evidence of the tests and of compliance with national laws and international guidelines.
• Conclusion: summary of what you have done and highlights of the best parts Delivery
• A single Zip file containing both the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for the website and a PDF with the project report. Via Inspera.

Due date
Tuesday 1st December 2020 at noon.
